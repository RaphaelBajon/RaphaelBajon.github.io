Following the **One Ocean Summit** held in Brest in February, we travelled to Lisbon to make the voice of early career researchers (ERC) and young scientists heard in the political arena. Shaking hands and making nice speeches were the order of the day, but above all it was an opportunity to be heard and to speak at a major international summit. The **Call for Actions** was also distributed.
