Thanks to a call from the French government to the **Universit√© de Bretagne Occidentale** (UBO), a team of young international researchers (later called **One Ocean University**) was formed to speak at the summit, in the form of a Call for Actions. This allowed young scientists working on a wide range of research topics to have their voices heard, to pool their expertise and to attend such an event. I had the opportunity to be part of it and I did not hesitate for a second.
