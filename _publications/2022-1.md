title: "Three-Dimensional Dispersion of Neutral “Plastic” Particles in a Global Ocean Model"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-1
excerpt: 'This article is the first one following an internship I did on plastic transport in the world ocean with Thierry Huck and the LOPS plastic team (to validate my double engineering school diploma). Here, plastic particles are initiated at the mouth of rivers and their trajectory is studied over 20 years of simulation. Strong accumulations are found near the sea surface and in the first 200 metres depth. Another paper on the influence of waves on plastic 3D distribution is left for future work.'
